# Jarvis

A high-reliability orchestration engine that bridges the gap between .NET expertise and functional programming mastery through AI-assisted technical content delivery.

## Overview

**Jarvis** is a robust, Haskell-based orchestration engine designed to manage the full lifecycle of the **Daily Haskell In Real Life** blog. Born from over 15 years of experience building high-consistency backend systems in the .NET ecosystem, this project serves as a pragmatic bridge for developers transitioning from enterprise imperative environments to the functional elegance of Haskell.

By leveraging the **Gemini 1.5 Pro API** and a **GitOps-driven deployment pipeline**, Jarvis automates topic selection—prioritized by real-world engagement metrics—while maintaining a strict "human-in-the-loop" review process via Discord. This project exemplifies a "Cyborg" workflow, where AI-powered research and drafting meet senior-level technical oversight.

## Core Objectives

* **Paradigm Bridge**: Document the transition from C#/.NET to Haskell through a senior-to-senior lens.
* **Data-Driven Content**: Utilize GitHub engagement and SEO metrics to prioritize technical pautas.
* **Engineering Excellence**: Showcase a complete Haskell ecosystem, including database persistence, multimodal AI integration, and automated CI/CD.
* **GitOps Maturity**: Automate the delivery of a Hugo-based site hosted on GitHub Pages with zero manual intervention.
